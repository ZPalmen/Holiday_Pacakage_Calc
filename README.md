# Holiday_Pacakage_Calc
Demonstrating knowledge of functions

## Project Details:

### Description
This was assigned as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in. 

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate my understanding of functions and how they can be used to prevent repeating code.

### Functionality
* Function defined to calculate the cost of a hotel based on user input for destination and total nights stay. Function returns the hotel total as a float data type.
  
* Function defined to calculate the cost of a flight based on user input for destination. Function returns the flight total as a float data type.

* Function defined to calculate the cost for car rental based on user input for total days. Function returns the rental total as a float data type.

* Function defined to calculate the total cost for the holiday using the predefined functions above. An if statement is used in case the user inputs 0 for car rental days. Function returns the holiday total as a float data type.

* Function defined to convert the input into Â£X.XX format.

* The code creates lists for destinations, hotels, flights and from there dictionaries are created with the destinations acting as Keys. I used integers in place of the country strings to allow easier functionality when the user is prompted for inputs.

* User is provided a list of destinations to choose from with an if statement nested in a while true loop preventing invalid inputs. Defensive programming is used to avoid ValueError.

* User is prompted to enter an integer for nights staying in a hotel. Defensive programming is used to avoid ValueError.

* User is prompted to enter an integer for how many days car rental. Defensive programming is used to avoid ValueError.

* The details of the holiday are printed to the user in a read-friendly format.

### How can I use it?
* You can clone the repository with the programme to a local repository on your computer so you can run the programme.

If you need help, please refer to the help page from github:

https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

With this being a programme written with Python, you will need to download the Python interpreter programme onto your operating system (os) so you can view and run the code.

### Contributors
* This programme was created as a solo project to fulfill the sofware engineering bootcamp requirements.
